    <h2>Sequences of Asanas</h2>
    Proper sequencing of asanas within a practice session plays an important role in achieving maximum benefit from the session.   After a well-sequenced session, one can reach below the surface of the skin and muscles and bones of the body and get in touch with the energetic body at a more cellular level.   Then a yogic mind begins to develop.   In some schools of yoga, such as the Ashtanga school, practice sessions are arranged into vinyasa or practice series.   One famous and ancient vinyasa practiced by all schools of yoga is the Surya Namaskar or "sun salutation."
    <br/>
    Sequencing of poses is a complex and advanced topic that requires extensive study and experience with the effects of asana sequences from your own practice.   Many factors influence the sequencing of asanas:   the weather, your age, your experience, how you're feeling mentally and physically on a certain day.  There are also different types of sequencing:
    <ul>
      <li>Sequencing movements within a pose</li>
      <li>Sequencing from one pose to another within a family</li>
      <li>Sequencing from one family of poses to another</li>
    </ul>
    The different categories of asanas exert different effects not only on your body, but also on your mind and emotions.   The standing poses promote emotional stability and strength.   The forward bends are calming -- even the very deepest forward bend should have a cooling effect, not a straining feeling.   The back bends are anti-depressive and elevate mood.   The inverted poses increase energy and engender equanimity and a sense of well-being.   Backbends are often given to students as a prescription for depression; and forward bends as a prescription for anxiety.
    <br/>
    More generally, good advice on sequencing can be thought of as general principles such as:
    <ul>
      <li>Standing poses are a good preparation for forward bends and also for back bends</li>
      <li>Adho Mukha Svanasana is a good preparation for all poses and also a good warm down after both forward bends and back bends.</li>
      <li>Don't alternate back and forth between forward bends and back bends</li>
      <li>It is not good to sequence active or heating poses after cooling poses</li>
      <li>Generally after a deep forward bend sequence consider doing a few twists to balance and release your spinal muscles</li>
      <li>It is especially important to warm-down skillfully from an active back bend session</li>
    </ul>
    Although, again, there are not strict rules governing the order of asanas within a session, some general principles can be used to allow the asanas to work more effectively together. Much depends upon the specific effect you are trying to get out of your session.   For instance, moving inversions earlier in the sequence would be good when you plan to expend a lot of energy on inversion variations since you have more energy near the beginning of your practice session than toward the end.
    <br/>
    Within a standing pose session per se, it is generally good to sequence them in an order such as this:
    <ul>
      <li>Lateral bends (e.g. Trikonasana, Parsvakonasana)</li>
      <li>Backbends (e.g. Virabhadrasana I)</li>
      <li>Twists and rotations (e.g. Parivrtta Trikonasana)</li>
      <li>Forward bends (e.g. Uttanasana)</li>
    </ul>
    It is appropriate at any point to use Uttanasana between any of the standing poses as a "neutral gear" to assimilate the effect of the previous pose and prepare for the next one in the sequence.   Prasarita Padottanasana is often done at the end of a standing pose sequence because the head is resting downward and the pose is quieting, too much so to sequence this pose in the middle of an active sequence.
