    <h2>Third Limb</h2>
    Is a teaching and productivity application for the practice of yoga <i>asana</i>, or
    poses. It is comprised of a collection of yoga postures, and provides for each a basic
    overview, a guide on proper form for performing the poses, and an exploration of the
    corresponding yoga philosophy.  It also includes a set of sequences that use these asanas,
    and can form the foundation for your yoga practice.
    <br/>
    <br/>

    <h3>Philosophy</h3>
     The practice of yoga is an art and science dedicated to creating union between body, mind
     and spirit.  Its objective is to assist the practitioner in using the breath and body to
     foster an awareness of ourselves as individualized beings intimately connected to the unified
     whole of creation. The core of Patanjaliâ€™s <i>Yoga Sutra</i> is an eight-limbed path that
     forms the structural framework for yoga practice.  In brief, the eight limbs, or <i>steps</i>
     of yoga are as follows:
    <br/>
    <ul>
      <li>Yamas (Universal morality)</li>
      <li>Niyamas (Personal observances)</li>
      <li>Asana (Body postures)</li>
      <li>Pranayama (Breathing exercises)</li>
      <li>Pratyahara (Control of the senses)</li>
      <li>Dharana (Concentrating and cultivating inner perceptual awareness)</li>
      <li>Dhyana (Devotion, meditation on the divine)</li>
      <li>Samadhi (Union with the divine)</li>
    </ul>
    <i>Asana</i>, the practice of moving the body into postures has widespread benefits; of these the most
    underlying are improved health, strength, balance and flexibility. On a deeper level the
    practice of asana, which means "staying" or "abiding" in Sanskrit, is used as a tool to calm
    the mind and move into the inner essence of being. This app provides you with a firm
    foundation to begin your practice with the <i>Third Limb</i> of yoga.
