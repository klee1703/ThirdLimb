    <h2>Third Limb</h2>
    is a teaching and productivity application for the practice of yoga <i>asana</i>, or
    poses. It is comprised of a collection of yoga postures, and provides for each a basic
    overview, a guide on proper form for performing the poses, and an exploration of the
    corresponding yoga philosophy.  It also includes a set of sequences that use these asanas,
    and can form the foundation for your yoga practice.

    <h3>Philosophy</h3>
    Yoga is not a religion, nor a therapy, nor a school, but rather a unification of the three.  Its study begins
    with a few golden rules, the <i>yamas</i> and <i>niyamas</i>.
    <br/>
    <ul>
      <li>Yamas</li>
      <ul>
        <li>Ahimsa</li>
        <li>Satya</li>
        <li>Asteya</li>
        <li>Brahmacharya</li>
        <li>Aparigraha</li>
      </ul>
      <li>Niyamas</li>
      <ul>
        <li>Sauca</li>
        <li>Santosa</li>
        <li>Tapas</li>
        <li>Svadhyaya</li>
        <li>Isvara pranidhana</li>
      </ul>
    </ul>
